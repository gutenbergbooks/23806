      Mr. John Amesbury, Senior Warden of St. Jude's Church, Minneapolis, to the
      Rev. Clement Markham:
    </p>
    <p>
      Vestry of St. Jude's, April 4th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Mr. Markham,&mdash;At a special meeting of the wardens and vestry of
      St. Jude's Church held this day, it was unanimously decided to grant your
      request for leave of absence from your duties as rector of this parish
      from June 1st till September 13th, inclusive, proximo, with permission to
      go abroad. I am instructed further to state that the wardens and vestry of
      St. Jude's have much pleasure in granting your request, as they feel that
      your zealous and very successful administration of the affairs of the
      parish has abundantly entitled you to a period of relaxation and rest.
      Your salary for the term of your absence will be paid to you in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my personal capacity, my dear Markham, permit me to add that I am
      delighted that you are to have this holiday. You richly deserve it.
      By-the-way, a good deal of amusement was caused by the rather
      characteristic error in the date of your formal application for leave.
      Were you to receive precisely the holiday that you asked for, you would
      have to turn back the wheels of time, for your letter was dated <i>last
      year!</i>

      St. Jude's Rectory, Minneapolis, May 15th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Aunt Lucy,&mdash;We are getting on famously with our preparations for
      the summer. Dear Clement is full of his visit to England, and I am sure
      that he will have a delightful time. The bishop has given him a letter of
      introduction to the Bishop of London, and another to Dean Rumford, of
      Canterbury, so a very desirable introduction to the best clerical society
      is assured to him. He expects to sail from New York on the <i>City of
      Paris</i> June 5th, and to sail from London on the same vessel on
      September 4th. This will bring him back to New York in plenty of time to
      get home to preach on the next Sunday, the 14th. He expects to write his
      sermon on the voyage. It would be delightful to go with him, but this is
      impossible on account of the children. I have engaged board for the summer
      at a small but very good hotel in the White Mountains&mdash;the Outlook
      House, Littleton, New Hampshire&mdash;and I expect to be very comfortable
      there. I made a funny mistake in writing for my rooms. I directed my first
      letter to Littleton, New York. Wasn't it absurd?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Clement expects to get some vestments in London, where they make them
      so well, you know, and he has promised to bring me from Paris&mdash;where
      he will spend a fortnight&mdash;two dozen pairs of gloves and six pairs of
      black silk stockings. Fancy my having six pairs of black silk stockings at
      once! I shall feel like a queen. The children are very well.

    </p>
    <p>
      On board "City of Paris," June 5th&mdash;3:80 p.m.... I stayed with my
      brother Ronald last night, and he and Van Cortlandt came down to see me
      off. I barely caught the steamer, for I forgot my watch&mdash;left it on
      the mantel-piece in Ronald's chambers&mdash;and did not remember it until
      we were half-way down town. Ronald said, in his chaffing way, that I left
      my head somewhere when I was a boy, and that I have been going around
      without it ever since. I wish that he and Van Cortlandt hadn't such silly
      notions about my incapacity in the ordinary affairs of life&mdash;not that
      I really mind their nonsense, for you know how well I love them both. I am
      very glad that you consented to go directly to the mountains instead of
      coming to New York to see me off. There was a great crowd on the dock, and
      I much prefer to think of our tender parting.... Be sure to cable me on
      the 15th&mdash;the day that I get to London. The address, you know, is
      simply, "Clement, London," and I am to arrange with my bankers to have the
      despatch sent to me. Good-bye, my&mdash;Here is the pilot.

    </p>
    <p>
      ... I had a delightful fortnight in Paris.... I bought the gloves and the
      stockings&mdash;it was droll, and not quite proper, about buying the
      stockings. I will tell you all about it when I get home. And I also bought
      you Something Else that I am sure will be a pleasant surprise to you when
      you see it....
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship, Dr.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, has been kindness itself to me. I
      dined again at Lambeth Palace yesterday&mdash;a farewell dinner. I was a
      little late, I am sorry to say, for I got into the wrong boat at
      Westminster Bridge, but his lordship very cordially accepted my excuses.
      At dinner I was seated next to a very interesting man who has charge of a
      large parish in the east end of London. Such poverty as there is in that
      wretched region, and such moral depravity, are sickening to contemplate.
      Thank Heaven, there is nothing like it in Minneapolis....
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall sail (D. V.) on the <i>City of Paris</i> two weeks from to-morrow.
      I think that the best arrangement will be for you to come down to your
      aunt Lucy's on the 11th, and on the 12th (D. V.) I will join you at her
      house in Boston, whence we will start for home that evening <i>via</i> the
      Boston and Albany. I must be in New York for a few hours to see Ronald and
      to make the final arrangements about the new stained-glass windows. If you
      prefer to meet me in New York, arrange matters with Ronald, who will meet
      you at the station and take you to a hotel. As I shall go directly to his
      office on landing, I will find out at once what you have decided to do....
      On referring to your letter of the 10th I perceive that you are afraid
      that I may have made some mistake about the sizes of the stockings and
      gloves. Of course I got the right sizes; I had it written down: "No. 61/4,
      long fingers," and "No. 8 1/2, narrow ankles." Don't fall into Ronald's
      way of fancying that I always get things wrong. It was about the narrow
      ankles that&mdash;But I had better wait and tell it to you when I get
      home. It certainly was very droll. I have bought a most satisfactory
      chasuble, very elegant in material and beautifully made. I should have
      hesitated to buy so costly a garment for myself; but this is for the
      Service of the Sanctuary. It will make something of a stir among the
      congregation, I think, the first time that I wear it in dear St.
      Jude's.... If, as is probable, I go down into Wales next week, this will
      be my last letter. My heart is full of joyful thankfulness to think that
      so very soon I shall see again (D. V.) my own dear Margaret, who....

      Littleton, August 29th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Aunt Lucy,&mdash;I have just received a long and delightful letter
      from dear Clement. He had a lovely time in Paris, and he has bought me the
      gloves and the silk stockings, and also Something Else; but he won't tell
      me what this other thing is, for he means it to be a surprise. Do you
      think it could <i>possibly</i> be the silk for a dress? He knows how much
      I want a new black silk. But I shall not think about it, for I don't want
      to be disappointed. He has had such delightful dinners with his lordship
      the Bishop of London at Lambeth Palace. His lordship was "kindness
      itself," Clement writes. Clement must have made a very favorable
      impression, of course. And Clement writes that he has bought such a love
      of a chasuble. It will stir up the whole congregation the first time that
      he wears it, I am sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is <i>quite</i> convenient to you, dear Aunt Lucy, I shall come down
      to you, with the nurse and the children, on the 11th. That is the day that
      Clement will arrive in New York, and he writes that he will come to Boston
      the next day&mdash;after seeing Ronald, and attending to the final
      arrangements about our beautiful new chancel windows&mdash;and join me at
      your house.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if this arrangement is the <i>least bit inconvenient</i> to you,
      please tell me so frankly, for I can perfectly well meet him in New York,
      where Ronald will take care of me till he comes&mdash;a plan that he also
      has arranged in case I do not go to you. Dear Clement always is so
      thoughtful and careful, you know. Please answer soon, so that I may know
      what to do. The weather is quite chilly here now. The children are brown
      as little berries and very well. Baby has cut another tooth.

      No. 19 Mount Vernon Place, August 30th. My dear Margaret,&mdash;I write at
      once because, I am very sorry to say, it will be impossible for me to have
      you here on the date that you name. I have just completed my arrangements
      for having the entire house papered and painted. All the furniture is
      locked up in the dining-room (that was done up, you remember, last
      summer), and I set out this afternoon on a round of visits that will fill
      up the time until September 12th, when I am promised that the work will be
      done. The servants are to have holidays and the painters and paper-hangers
      are to be in complete possession of the premises. Could I be sure that
      they would keep their promises and get through by the 12th, I should urge
      your coming on that day, which still would be in time to meet Clement,
      instead of on the 11th. But you know how uncertain people of this sort
      are. Much as I would love to have you and Clement with me, I think that
      you had better follow out your second plan, and go to Ronald's care in New
      York.

      letter from Aunt Lucy in which she says that her house is torn up, and
      that we cannot possibly come to her before the 12th. Therefore I must
      adopt the other plan that dear Clement, with his usual thoughtfulness, has
      suggested, which is to meet him in New York. He tells me to ask you to
      engage rooms for me in some quiet hotel, and also to ask you to meet me on
      my arrival with the children and nurse. I shall leave here on the morning
      of the 10th by the White Mountain Express (that gets in at Jersey City, I
      think); and if you will care for me in the way that Clement suggests, I
      shall be very grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clement has had a lovely time during his holiday. He has been especially
      favored by seeing a great deal of the higher clergy. He has dined
      repeatedly with the Lord Archbishop of London at Lambeth Palace, and I am
      sure that he must have created a very favorable impression among them, and
      given them a highly satisfactory idea of the clergymen of the American
      branch of the Anglican Church. Please answer soon, so that I may know what
      to do. I forgot to say that Clement expects to arrive on the 11th. He is
      to sail on the 4th.

      Mrs. Clement Markham to Mr. Hubert Van Cortlandt, New York:
    </p>
    <p>
      Littleton, September 5th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Mr. Van Cortlandt,&mdash;By a telegram that I have just received from
      Ronald, I find that he is in Texas. I had written to him to ask him to
      secure rooms for me at some quiet hotel, and to meet me at Jersey City on
      the evening of the 10th, on the arrival of the White Mountain Express. Of
      course he cannot do this now, and he telegraphs me to ask you to do it all
      in his place. I feel that I am taking a great liberty in asking so much of
      you, but I really cannot help myself. I had expected to meet Clement in
      Boston at my aunt's, but my aunt is out of town; and now Ronald is away
      from New York. It is very provoking. So, you see, I can only throw myself
      on your mercy. But I do this with the less hesitation because I know how
      strong your friendship is for my dear Clement, who will be, as I will be
      also, very grateful to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very much puzzled by a cable despatch from Clement that came two days
      ago. It reads, "Sail to-day," and is dated September <i>third</i>.
      Clement's passage was engaged on the <i>City of Paris</i>, which I know
      was advertised to sail on September <i>fourth</i>, and that is the date
      that he all along has named for his return. Can the date of sailing have
      been changed? Ought I to come to New York one day earlier? Everything
      seems to be going wrong of late, and I am both worried and perplexed. If
      you can think of any comforting explanation that will account for this
      change, I shall be very much obliged to you. Please give my kindest
      regards to Mrs. Van Cortlandt.

      New York, September 7th.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Mrs. Markham,&mdash;Your favor of the 5th is received. I am very
      glad indeed that I shall have this opportunity to serve you. You must not
      consider yourself under any obligation at all. Remember how close Clement
      is to me, though our ways in life have separated widely, and how true his
      friendship has been to me through all these years. I am delighted that
      Ronald is out of town, and that I am to be permitted to serve you in his
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I regret exceedingly that Mrs. Van Cortlandt is still in the Catskills,
      and that our house still remains in its condition of summer dismantlement.
      Were she at home, and the house in order, you would come directly to us,
      of course. As this cannot be, I have engaged an apartment for you with my
      old landlady, Mrs. Warden, No. 68 Clinton Place. For a number of years
      before I was married I occupied rooms in this house, and I am confident
      that you will be far more comfortable there than you possibly could be at
      any hotel. Mrs. Warden, who is a motherly old body, and who remembers
      Clement well, will take the best of care of you, and I have arranged that
      your meals shall be sent across to you from the Brevoort.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to Clement's cable despatch, I am as much puzzled as you are.
      One of my young men has just returned from the office of the Inman Line,
      and reports that the <i>City of Paris</i> sailed on her regular date, the
      4th, and is due to arrive here on Wednesday next, the 11th. My young man
      was assured that no steamer belonging to any of the regular lines left
      Liverpool for this port on the 3d. The Cunard steamer <i>Samaria</i> did
      leave Liverpool on the 3d, however, for Boston. It is possible, of course&mdash;since
      your original plan seems to have been that you and Clement should meet in
      Boston&mdash;that he has sailed in the <i>Samaria</i>. But I do not think
      that this is probable. The <i>Samaria</i> is a much slower boat than the
      <i>City of Paris</i>, and I think that even Clement would perceive that by
      sailing in her he would lose time instead of gaining it. Frankly, my dear
      Mrs. Markham, I think that Clement simply has mixed things up in his
      despatch by writing "today" when he meant "to-morrow." Bless his dear old
      heart! he always did have a faculty for getting things wrong, you know. I
      decidedly advise you, therefore, to come down to New York on the 10th, as
      you have already arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      I observe that you speak of the White Mountain Express as coming in at
      Jersey City. This is a mistake: it arrives at the Forty-second Street
      Station. Bear this fact in mind, please; and I advise you to write on a
      card&mdash;which you had better have easily accessible in your pocket-book&mdash;Mrs.
      Warden's address, No. 68 Clinton Place. Then, should I miss you in the
      crowd at the station, or should any other mischance occur in regard to our
      meeting, you will know where to tell your driver to take you, and where to
      send your trunks. Do not fear that any such untoward accident will occur:
      it is only professional prudence that leads me to provide for every
      contingency that may arise. As a further precautionary measure (we lawyers
      are full of precautionary measures, you know), please telegraph me from
      Littleton on the morning that you leave.

    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Mr. Van Cortlandt,&mdash;Your very kind letter came last evening. I
      cannot tell you how grateful I am to you for all your goodness and
      thoughtfulness. With such explicit directions I cannot possibly go wrong.
      You must be right, I think, in regard to the cable despatch. Such a
      mistake would be just what dear Clement would be almost certain to make
      when in one of his absent-minded moods. I will do all the prudent things
      which you so thoughtfully advise, and I shall keep your letter to show to
      dear Clement, so that he may know how much trouble you have taken to make
      everything about my arrival secure. Of course, the train does not come in
      at Jersey City: I remember about it now perfectly. I am in the thick of
      packing to-day, and expect to get off in the morning; but I will telegraph
      you before I start. I don't want to bother you with this letter at your
      office, so I send it to your house. I find the address in Clement's
      address-book. Am I not considerate?

      But I got along very well, thanks to your forethought in telling me just
      what to do, though I must confess that I had five very dreadful minutes
      while I was looking for the card on which I had written Mrs. Warden's
      address. And where do you suppose I found it at last? It was in my
      pocket-book, just where you told me to put it! Wasn't it absurd? So then
      we came down here very comfortably, and found the delightful apartment
      that you had secured for me. As for Mrs. Warden, she is as good as gold.
      She even had warm milk ready for Teddy, and a delicious cup of tea for me.
      I never shall be able to thank you enough for all that you have done.

      of neglect. Mrs. Van Cortlandt now out of danger.

      The Rev. Clement Markham to Mr. Ronald Markham, San Antonio, Texas:
    </p>
    <p>
      [Telegram.] Breyoort House, New York, September 12th. Van Cortlandt in
      Catskills with sick wife. Saw his partner, Edgecombe, who can tell me
      nothing.

    <p>
      I have ascertained that Margaret left Littleton day before yesterday for
      this city. With her departure from Littleton all trace of her is lost. She
      has not returned to Minneapolis. I am wellnigh crazed with grief and
      anxiety. Advise me at once what is best to be done. Shall I advertise?
      Will it be well to employ the police? For Heaven's sake, answer promptly
      and fully!

    <p>
      68 Clinton Place, New York, September 12th. <i>City of Paris</i> arrived.
      Mrs. Warden been to dock and got passenger list. Clement's name in it, so
      he certainly made mistake in his cable despatch. I state facts fully and
      clearly, so that you may understand why Mr. Van Cortlandt was called
      suddenly to see sick wife in Catskills, and so, while Clement must be here
      in New York, perhaps close by me, am unable to find him, and he, of
      course, does not in the least know where to find me. There are hundreds of
      hotels here in New York, and he may be at all of them. I don't know what
      to do, and am almost frantic with anxiety. Telegraph me at once, dear Aunt
      Lucy, and make telegram perfectly clear, like mine, and long and full and
      explicit. This is no time to think about what telegraphing costs. Perhaps
      Clement has gone on to you, or the other ship may have got in sooner. If
      he is with you, implore him to return to me at once. Would it be well for
      me to employ the police? That was my first thought, but I was afraid that
      I might make his disappearance get into the newspapers and be a scandal,
      and that would not do for a clergyman. And he has not really disappeared;
      it is only that we neither of us know where we each are. My head is one
      horrible buzz. Shall I advertise? Had I better offer a reward? Give me
      your best advice, dear Aunt Lucy, and please answer immediately.

    </p>
    <p>
      St. Jude's Rectory, Minneapolis, September 23d.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Aunt Lucy,&mdash;We left New York early last Monday, and by Tuesday
      night we were once more safe and together here in our own dear home. We
      had no misadventures on our journey, except that we nearly missed our
      connection at Syracuse (where we left the parlor-car for the sleeper) by
      getting on the wrong train. Fortunately dear Clement found out his mistake
      just in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not the energy to do more than telegraph you from New York that all
      our troubles were ended. I was too much upset by the agony that I had been
      through to write. It was a very dreadful two days, dear Aunt Lucy; the
      most dreadful&mdash;especially that second day and the last night&mdash;that
      I have ever known. And dear Clement suffered even more than I did, for I
      knew at least that he was alive, and he knew absolutely nothing about me
      at all. It all seems now like a horrible dream, and when I shut my eyes
      and think about it, I turn giddy and feel sick and faint. You cannot
      possibly imagine, dear Aunt Lucy, how utterly, utterly dreadful it all
      was!
    </p>
    <p>
      If it had not been so very dreadful, it would have been a little absurd, I
      think; for, you know, all the while that we were in such terrible distress
      about being unable to find each other, we actually could have opened our
      windows and talked to each other just across the street! As I found out,
      when at last dear Clement came to me, his room in the Brevoort House was
      directly opposite my apartment at No. 68 Clinton Place. Was it not
      strange? And what was still stranger, dear Aunt Lucy, was that the very
      morning that our agony ended I happened to look across the street, and
      there, hanging beside an open window of the hotel, I saw a lovely chasuble
      that I knew must belong to some clergyman, and it made me think of the
      chasuble that Clement had written he had bought in London&mdash;and it
      really was that very chasuble, you know, for Clement had hung it there to
      get the creases out of it&mdash;and seeing it set me into a perfect agony
      of grief, for I thought that I never was to see my dear husband again, and
      that my children were fatherless, and that I was a widow, and that there
      was nothing left for me in the world but the blackest despair. And it was
      while I was crying my very heart out that there was a knock at the door,
      and then, in a single instant, all my sorrow was ended as I found myself
      once more in dear Clement's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday dear Clement preached a beautiful sermon about man's liability
      to error, and the mysterious ways through which human error providentially
      is set right. It was a very impressive sermon. In the service he wore his
      new chasuble. It is exceedingly becoming. Everybody was very much moved by
      the sermon; and I was moved, of course, most of all. I could not help
      crying. Dear Clement's voice trembled once or twice, and I saw that there
      were tears in his eyes. The gloves are perfect, and the stockings really
      are too good to be true. They are open-work over the ankles, and three of
      the six pairs are ribbed. I wish that I could tell you what a queer time
      dear Clement had when he was buying them. He bought them in a French shop
      in Paris, you know; and when he asked for stockings with narrow ankles,
      the young woman who was waiting on him&mdash;But it will be better to wait
      until I can tell it to you. It was very funny. And the very best of all,
      dear Aunt Lucy, is that the surprise that Clement would not write to me
      about <i>is</i> the silk for a new black silk dress! It is a lovely
      quality. I do wish that you could have heard Clement's beautiful sermon
      yesterday, and that you could have seen how handsome he looked in his new
      chasuble. The weather to-day is very warm. The children are wonderfully
      well.
